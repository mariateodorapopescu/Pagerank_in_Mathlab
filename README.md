# Numerical Methods Odyssey 🌌

Buckle up for a journey through the corridors of time to the early days of your academic quest – a tale that began in the hallowed halls of Numerical Methods during your first year. An old assignment, a relic from the archives, now rises from the depths to share its story.

## PR_Inv: Unveiling the Matrix Tapestry 🎭

In the ancient times of your first-year numerical escapades, the PR_Inv algorithm took center stage. The quest began with the mystique of QR factorization using the venerable Gram-Schmidt method.

- **Vector Chronicles:** Columns of matrix A danced to the tune of Gram-Schmidt, each vector a protagonist in the unfolding drama.
- **Matrix Alchemy:** Q and R matrices emerged from the ether, their dimensions a reflection of the arcane properties of A.
- **Inverse Conundrum:** The grand finale revealed the hidden relationship between Q, R, and the enigmatic inverse of A.

## Pagerank: Navigating Algorithmic Terrain 🗺️

Fast forward to the Pagerank era, where iterative and algebraic spells wove a tapestry of web page ranking.

- **Dual Methodology:** Pagerank revealed its dual nature through both iterative and algebraic incantations.
- **File Symphony:** Nodes and matrices took center stage as the algorithmic overture played out.
- **Stochastic Ballet:** The elegance of matrices transformed into the stochastic dance of M, setting the stage for iterative elegance.
- **Iterative Odyssey:** The iterative journey unfolded, with nodes converging toward the elusive Pagerank vector.

## Apartenenta: The Harmony of Continuity 🎶

From the algorithmic past emerges the artistry of continuity in the Apartenenta section.

- **Maestro's Touch:** The dance of continuity in function u(x) unfolded, guided by the maestro's touch of limits.
- **Formulas of Elegance:** Constants a and b stepped forth, crafting an elegant transition between intervals.
